ev3devKit
=========

Programming toolkit for ev3dev

This is a [GLib]/[GObject] based library that provides a number of programming
interfaces for ev3dev, including user interface and device driver interface.
It is written in vala, but since it uses GObjects, it can be used with many
[languages] via [GObjectIntrospection].

For an example of how it is used, checkout [brickman].

Hacking
-------

* Clone the repo

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3devKit


## Cross-compiling for the EV3 (to do)

This requires that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed. (On
Linux, you will also need to install the `qemu-user-static` package.)

    cd ev3devKit
    ./docker/setup.sh $ARCH
    docker exec --tty ev3devkit_$ARCH make install

Substitute `$ARCH` with `armel` for the EV3 or `armhf` for RPi/BeagleBone.
When the build is completed, copy the files from `build-$ARCH/dist` to your EV3.


## Compiling for desktop

    # include install build depends
    $ sudo apt-get install cmake valac libgirepository1.0-dev \
    libgudev-1.0-dev libgrx-3.0-dev libgtk-3-dev
    $ cmake -P setup.cmake
    $ make -C build


## Running

When building for the desktop, one can run the demos using `make -C build run<tab>`. In
order to run them on the device, copy the demos over or share the folder via NFS
or sshfs with the EV3. When copying them to /home/user, the demos are runable
from the file-browser.
